# Viceroy

An artificially intelligent reader view for detecting and categorizing bias in an article or web page.

We will likely need a model, or models, capable of at least these three Tasks:

Creating a browser extension like Viceroy would involve a multi-step process, encompassing UI/UX design, front-end and back-end development, as well as the integration of large language models for content analysis. Below is a high-level approach to building Viceroy:

### 1. UI/UX Design:

- Design a minimalistic and elegant UI. Utilize a soft white/beige cream-colored background with a firm, but not bold, font.
- Include a settings page where users can:
  - Toggle image inclusion in reader-view.
  - Choose if the reader view activates automatically or manually.

### 2. Front-End Development:

- Develop the browser extension using JavaScript.
- Utilize browser's native APIs or libraries like `webextension-polyfill` for creating the extension compatible with multiple browsers.
- Implement the logic to scrape the webpage's HTML content and remove unnecessary clutter (ads, pop-ups, etc.). Libraries like `DOMPurify` can help sanitize and process the HTML.
- For the reader-view, use CSS to style the scraped content according to the design.

### 3. Back-End Development:

- Although much of the extension will run on the client side, you'll need a back-end to:
  - Store user preferences.
  - Interface with the language model for content analysis.

### 4. Language Model Integration:

- Integrate a large language model (e.g., BART, Llama-2) to:
  - Summarize the content.
  - Categorize and detect bias.
  - If desired by the user, rewrite the article to remove bias.
- This step would likely involve API calls to a cloud service hosting the model. For efficiency, consider sending only relevant parts of the article to the model.

### 5. Bias Reporting:

- Once the bias is identified, display it to the user in an intuitive manner within the reader view. Consider using color-coded labels or icons to indicate the type and degree of bias.

### 6. Performance Optimization:

- Ensure that Viceroy runs efficiently:
  - Use asynchronous operations to avoid blocking the main thread.
  - Optimize the content scraping logic.
  - Limit the size of data sent to the back-end for analysis.
  - Cache results for previously analyzed web pages to reduce repeated processing.

### 7. Testing and Deployment:

- Test the extension on various websites to ensure accuracy and performance.
- Make sure it's compatible with popular web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.
- Once satisfied, deploy the extension to browser-specific stores.

### Challenges & Considerations:

1. **Bias Detection:** Detecting and categorizing bias is a complex task. No model is perfect, so there may be false positives or negatives.
2. **Rewriting Content:** Rewriting articles to remove bias can be challenging. The rewritten content might lose nuances or inadvertently introduce new biases.
3. **Privacy Concerns:** Users might be concerned about their browsing data being sent to a back-end server for analysis. Ensure transparency and robust privacy policies.
4. **Performance:** Analyzing content using large language models can be resource-intensive. You'll need to balance between analysis accuracy and performance.
5. **Adaptability:** Websites frequently update their structures. The extension needs regular updates to maintain its efficiency in content scraping.

Given the complexity of this project, it would be wise to start with a prototype, focusing on core features. Once the prototype is validated, you can iteratively improve and add more advanced functionalities.

Building a full-fledged application like Viceroy is a comprehensive project that would typically involve several developers and iterations. However, I can provide a basic outline and some code snippets to get you started.


### 5. Integration with Language Model:

This would likely be done on a backend server due to the computational intensity and potential costs associated with using models like BART or Llama-2. You'd have an API on the backend that the extension communicates with.

Remember, this is a very basic outline. Building Viceroy requires a lot of refinement, additional features, error handling, and testing.
