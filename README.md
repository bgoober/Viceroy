# Viceroy
An artificially intelligent reader view for detecting and categorizing bias in an article or web page.

From GPT-4

Creating a browser extension like Viceroy would involve a multi-step process, encompassing UI/UX design, front-end and back-end development, as well as the integration of large language models for content analysis. Below is a high-level approach to building Viceroy:

### 1. UI/UX Design:

- Design a minimalistic and elegant UI. Utilize a soft white/beige cream-colored background with a firm, but not bold, font.
- Include a settings page where users can:
  - Toggle image inclusion in reader-view.
  - Choose if the reader view activates automatically or manually.

### 2. Front-End Development:

- Develop the browser extension using JavaScript.
- Utilize browser's native APIs or libraries like `webextension-polyfill` for creating the extension compatible with multiple browsers.
- Implement the logic to scrape the webpage's HTML content and remove unnecessary clutter (ads, pop-ups, etc.). Libraries like `DOMPurify` can help sanitize and process the HTML.
- For the reader-view, use CSS to style the scraped content according to the design.

### 3. Back-End Development:

- Although much of the extension will run on the client side, you'll need a back-end to:
  - Store user preferences.
  - Interface with the language model for content analysis.

### 4. Language Model Integration:

- Integrate a large language model (e.g., BART, Llama-2) to:
  - Summarize the content.
  - Categorize and detect bias.
  - If desired by the user, rewrite the article to remove bias.
- This step would likely involve API calls to a cloud service hosting the model. For efficiency, consider sending only relevant parts of the article to the model.

### 5. Bias Reporting:

- Once the bias is identified, display it to the user in an intuitive manner within the reader view. Consider using color-coded labels or icons to indicate the type and degree of bias.

### 6. Performance Optimization:

- Ensure that Viceroy runs efficiently:
  - Use asynchronous operations to avoid blocking the main thread.
  - Optimize the content scraping logic.
  - Limit the size of data sent to the back-end for analysis.
  - Cache results for previously analyzed web pages to reduce repeated processing.

### 7. Testing and Deployment:

- Test the extension on various websites to ensure accuracy and performance.
- Make sure it's compatible with popular web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.
- Once satisfied, deploy the extension to browser-specific stores.

### Challenges & Considerations:

1. **Bias Detection:** Detecting and categorizing bias is a complex task. No model is perfect, so there may be false positives or negatives.
2. **Rewriting Content:** Rewriting articles to remove bias can be challenging. The rewritten content might lose nuances or inadvertently introduce new biases.
3. **Privacy Concerns:** Users might be concerned about their browsing data being sent to a back-end server for analysis. Ensure transparency and robust privacy policies.
4. **Performance:** Analyzing content using large language models can be resource-intensive. You'll need to balance between analysis accuracy and performance.
5. **Adaptability:** Websites frequently update their structures. The extension needs regular updates to maintain its efficiency in content scraping.

Given the complexity of this project, it would be wise to start with a prototype, focusing on core features. Once the prototype is validated, you can iteratively improve and add more advanced functionalities.

Building a full-fledged application like Viceroy is a comprehensive project that would typically involve several developers and iterations. However, I can provide a basic outline and some code snippets to get you started.

### 1. Browser Extension Manifest (manifest.json):

This is essential for any browser extension. This example is for a Chrome extension:

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "Viceroy",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "Clean and bias-free reading experience.",
  "permissions": ["activeTab", "storage"],
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "background.js"
  },
  "action": {
    "default_popup": "popup.html",
    "default_icon": {
      "16": "icons/icon16.png",
      "48": "icons/icon48.png",
      "128": "icons/icon128.png"
    }
  },
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["<all_urls>"],
      "js": ["content.js"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Popup UI (popup.html):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Viceroy</title>
  <style>
    body {
      background-color: #F5ECE3; /* soft beige color */
      font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
      width: 250px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h2>Viceroy Reader</h2>
  <button id="activate">Activate Reader View</button>
</body>
</html>
```

### 3. Content Script (content.js):

This script will be responsible for scraping the page content and initiating the content cleanup.

```javascript
function removeClutter() {
  // Logic to remove ads, pop-ups, and other non-essential elements
  // You'd likely need more advanced logic and perhaps some libraries to assist.
  const ads = document.querySelectorAll('.ad, .popup');
  ads.forEach(ad => ad.remove());

  // More code here for additional processing...
}

// Listen for a message from the popup to activate the reader view
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((message, sender, sendResponse) => {
  if (message.action === 'activateReaderView') {
    removeClutter();
    sendResponse({status: 'success'});
  }
});
```

### 4. Background Script (background.js):

This script can listen to browser events and communicate with the content script.

```javascript
chrome.action.onClicked.addListener((tab) => {
  // Send a message to the content script to activate the reader view
  chrome.scripting.executeScript({
    target: {tabId: tab.id},
    function: removeClutter
  });
});
```

### 5. Integration with Language Model:

This would likely be done on a backend server due to the computational intensity and potential costs associated with using models like BART or Llama-2. You'd have an API on the backend that the extension communicates with.

Remember, this is a very basic outline. Building Viceroy requires a lot of refinement, additional features, error handling, and testing.
